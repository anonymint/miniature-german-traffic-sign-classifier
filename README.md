## Traffic Sign Classifier

Overview
---
In this project, we will see how we can create our model from scratch and then use that to predict the images randomly downloaded from the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results please see [Summary](Summary.ipynb)

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the [data set]([German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)).
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anonymint/traffic-sign-classifier.git
cd traffic-sign-classifier
jupyter notebook traffic_sign_classifier.ipynb
```
